When you have a version ready for deployment, run the following commands...

grunt build --force

This will build the app, compress it and put it in the dist folder. Then run...

grunt ssh_deploy:staging        [For beta]
OR
grunt ssh_deploy:production		[For production]

This will upload it to our server and make the necessary linkages.
